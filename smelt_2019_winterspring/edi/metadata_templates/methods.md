# Methods

## Deployment and Retrieval 

1.	In January 2019, 384 adult Delta Smelt (243 days post hatch) were transferred  to six enclosures in Rio Vista (64 fish per cage) using black 19L buckets with screw top lids.
2.	Fish were retrieved after approximately one month.
3.	In February 2019, 360 adult Delta Smelt (278 days post hatch) were transferred to six enclosures in the Deepwater Shipping Channel (60 fish per cage) using black 19L buckets with screw top lids.
4.	Fish were retrieved after approximately one month.
5.	There were three different types of enclosures (n=2 for each type). See table below for details. 

| Enclosure design type | Side/bottom material | Hole size (mm) | Center to center distance (mm) | Openness (%) | Mesh size of wrap (mm) |
| --------- | --------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | 
| A = small | perforated steel sheet | 3.18 | 4.76 | 41 | NA |
| B = large | perforated steel sheet | 3.97 | 4.76 | 63 | NA |
| C = wrap  | perforated steel sheet with outer wrap of stainless steel mesh on lower 50% | 3.97 | 4.76 | 63 + mesh | 4x4 |

## Field Data Collection

### Water Quality

1. During site visits, a YSI Pro DSS was used to collect measurements of water temperature (C), dissolved oxygen (mg/L), specific conductivity (µSiemens/cm), electric conductivity (µSiemens/cm), pH, and turbidity (FNU) approximately 1m below the surface
2. A secchi disc was used to collect secchi depth (m)
3. Velocity measurements were taken using a portable handheld velocity meter (m3/s, Hach, model #FH950) which was angled to face the direction of highest velocity
  * Since velocity was highly variable, three 10-second average replicate velocity readings were collected

### Zooplankton

1. Zooplankton were collected during each site visit using a 53 μm mesh conical 0.5 m x 2 m plankton net (SEA-GEAR) with a General Oceanics flowmeter (Model 2030R) suspended from the center of the net mouth 
2. Tows were collected just below the surface for 2 minutes
3. When high winds precluded boat-based sampling, a plankton net was hand towed along a nearby dock 5.0 – 6.5 m (dimensions: 0.3 m x 1 m, 53 μm mesh)
4. All samples were stored in 1 L wide-mouth Nalgene bottles and preserved with 5% formalin dyed with Rose Bengal

## Lab Sample Processing and Tracking

### Fish Measurements

1. Fish were obtained from the University of California – Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Laboratory (FCCL). 
2. Prior to deployment of fish in the field, fish were anesthetized with MS-222 (Tricaine Methanesulfonate) and weighed (g), measured (fork length; mm) and tagged with Visible Implant Alphanumeric (VIA) tags (Northwest Marine Technology Inc, Olympia, WA). 
3. After fish were collected from the field at the end of the study period, fish were euthanized with MS-222 (400 mg/L). Each fish was weighed (g), measured (fork Length; mm), identified (VIA tag) and preserved in formalin.

### Zooplankton

1. Samples were enumerated and identified by BSA Environmental Services, Inc. (Beachwood, OH USA) 
2. Individuals were identified to genus for cladocerans, order for harpacticoids, and species and life stage for calanoid and cyclopoid copepods

### Diet

1. After fish were collected from the field at the end of the study period, 10 fish per enclosure (60 fish per site) were assessed for diet
2. 2-3 fish were randomly selected from discrete size bins
3. The fish were dissected and the stomachs (no intestines) were removed, cleaned of any other tissue, and preserved in 10% formalin
4. Stomachs were removed and sent to the University of Washington’s Wetland Ecosystem Team laboratory (WET lab; Seattle, WA USA) for analysis
5. The total contents of each stomach were weighed and enumerated
6. When possible (not too digested), individuals were identified to genus for cladocerans, order for harpacticoids, and species and life stage for calanoid and cyclopoid copepods

## Quality Assurance and Control

### Data quality control

1. Field data were checked before leaving the site by a different crew member than the recorder
2. Datasheets were reviewed when entered into Excel and a separate staff member compared the field datasheets to the entered data
3. During analysis, data were reviewed for outliers and suspect data was flagged or removed

### Instrument quality control
1. The YSI Pro DSS used to collect discrete water quality was calibrated, following standard protocols (YSI “ProDSS Calibration Guide”), monthly for all sensors and each morning prior to sampling for dissolved oxygen
2. The Hach FH950 flowmeter was calibrated following manufacturer guidelines (“Hach FH950 Basic User Manual”) prior to the start of the sampling season

## Notes on Data Quality: 

1. For Delta Smelt measurements, tags were occasionally shed, mis-read, or fish died in enclosures, leading to pre-deployment measurements that didn’t have a post-deployment match, and vice versa. This meant we were unable to calculate condition factorand changes in fork length, weight for these fish.
2. The method of zooplankton collection (boat tows vs. hand-tow) may affect the data quality in ways that are not fully understood.

### Calculations and Analysis

* Biomass estimates for zooplankton were obtained from the San Francisco State University Kimmerer lab’s unpublished synthesized biomass dataset. For less common zooplankton species that did not have a unique estimated biomass, an average of the biomass across other species within the order was applied as a proxy.

* Fulton’s Condition factor (K) was calculated for fish as a measure of fish condition: K = Weight/(Fork Length^3) x 10^2

* Delta\_x = Post\_x - Pre\_x, where x = CF, FL\_cm or Weight\_g

* PropChangex = Delta\_x/Pre\_x, where x = CF, FL\_cm or Weight\_g
