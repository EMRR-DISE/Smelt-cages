The endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus is an osmerid fish endemic to the upper San Francisco Estuary. A captive breeding program for the species led by the Fish Culture and Conservation Laboratory (FCCL), University of California, Davis, began in 1996 to create a refuge population. In order to better understand how captive Delta Smelt would fare in conditions outside of the hatchery, we placed captive-reared fish in enclosures in the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta, and evaluated their ability to survive, feed, and maintain condition. 

Fish were acclimated in the hatchery at FCCL, tagged, swabbed, weighed, measured, and transferred to enclosures in the field. There were three types of enclosures (n=2 for each type), varying in mesh size and wrap condition. In January 2019, 384 adult Delta Smelt (243 days post hatch) were transferred to enclosures in Rio Vista. In February 2019, 360 adult Delta Smelt (278 days post hatch) were transferred to enclosures in the Deepwater Shipping Channel. For each deployment, fish remained in enclosures for approximately one month, then were retrieved from enclosures, euthanized, identified, weighed and measured. A subset were also analyzed for diet contents. During the one-month long deployments, cages were checked for biofouling, damage, and dead fish, and water quality measurements and zooplankton samples were collected.
