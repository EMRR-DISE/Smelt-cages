#Stomach Weights--------------

#Arielle sent an updated spreadsheet with all the stomach weights on June 12 2025
#she took stomach weights in all years but didn't include them since it wasn't part of the contract, but part of their protocol
#want to add these so we can publish with them
#Description of the categories:
# Full weight is what it weighs right out of the fish, and before you take out the contents
# Empty stomach weight is after you process the guts
# Difference is just those weights subtracted
# Total contents weight is when you weighed the prey that you dissected from the stomach, which is sometimes 0 due to the size of the prey and the scale not precise enough to pick it upâ€¦. Or its plant material or something. Sometimes the difference in the two weights despite no contents is water 

#need to read in each sheet and then combine, and then merge with the larger dataframe for one large dataset
#need to make a fish ID so can connect it
#also need to make sure the column types match since some weights have NAs. All should be a character
#need to make sure to join with the taxa column too
